# graphql-api-covid-19
ðŸ¦  graphql api of covi-19 in Brazil

# Under construction

## motivation
This API I create in the begin of the pandemic to see more clear data and create some graphics to visualize better.
At the time, the https://covid.saude.gov.br/ only expose a button to download .csv file and some graphics, I made a script that read this file and create and GraphQL Api with the data.
The idea is to use puppeteer to download the .csv file to get more updated data.

## result 
API works but still missing the implementation of puppeteer, at the time I don't have the mental health to do this and this project was stopped.
